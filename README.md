A Streamlit-based application for capturing and analyzing the 21cm hydrogen line using RTL-SDR devices to study galactic rotation.

## Key Features
RTL-SDR Integration: Captures radio signals at 1420 MHz (hydrogen line) and 1422 MHz (reference)
Spectral Analysis: Performs FFT processing and spectral averaging to detect hydrogen signals
Galactic Dynamics Calculations
  - Radial velocity (Vr) and proper motion components (Ur, Ut)
  - Distance estimates to gas clouds
  - Galactic center distance calculations
 Visualization: Three-panel plot showing spectra comparison and analysis results
- Data Logging: Automatically saves spectrum data and results in CSV format
